# Oregon Trail Board Game Online

**Contributor**: `Bobby Nguyen`

**Created on**: `August 19 2019`

## Introduction 

A MERN app based off The Oregon Trails card game that is based on the video game of the same name. The idea to recreate this board game came from playing when I was camping with some friends from college. We had so much fun playing this simple board game because it remind us about the time when we played the computer games when we were all kids in elemetary school. Unforutnately, after college we all moved to different cities and are too far away from each other to have a game night ever so often. The purpose of this project was so I may be able to play with my friends from any where they are and keep connected with the fun that these games have brought us. 

## How to play
If you are unfamiliar with the rules, here are [instructions](http://www.geekyhobbies.com/the-oregon-trail-card-game-review-and-rules/) on how to play.

## Technologies
- MongoDB
- Express.js
- React.js
- Redux.js
- Node.js

## Future Plans
Currently the game is in its pre-Alpha and many of the features from the board game is not yet available. I would like the game to host up to six people for multiplayer and a chat box option using socket.io. I would also like to have a drop-and-drag option similar to the one on Hearthstone, which react-dnd may help accomplish. 

## Process
The plan to make this board game into a reality started off by playing the actual, physical board game. By playing, it gave me the a better understanding on the game logic and how the game works. I made a flow chart that would help visualize the logic and how each turn can play out.
