# Oregon Trail Board Game Online

## Introduction 

A MERN app based off The Oregon Trails card game that is based on the video game of the same name. The idea to recreate this board game came from playing when I was camping with some friends from college. We had so much fun playing this simple board game because it remind us about the time when we played the computer games when we were all kids in elemetary school. Unforutnately, after college we all moved to different cities and are too far away from each other to have a game night ever so often. The purpose of this project was so I may be able to play with my friends from any where they are and keep connected with the fun that these games have brought us.
